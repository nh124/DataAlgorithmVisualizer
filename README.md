# Algorithm Visualizer

##### This is a algorithm visualizer that help visualize algorithm such as Linkedlist, Binary Search Tree, Sorting, Pathfinding, etc.

## Who is this for?

This project is a instructive platform where students, teachers, and professionals can come and learn the different algorithms.

- The platform help break down each step of algorithm, and creats a visuals at the same time.
- Code is generated as the each algorithm plays, and creats explaineations for each step.
- This project currently consists of the linkedlist Algorithm, more algorithms will be added.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   },
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
